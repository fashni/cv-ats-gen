## Highlights
- Generates a CV from a YAML file
- Outputs ATS-friendly HTML with simple, structured styling
- Serves the result using a local HTTP server

The YAML files must be placed in the `cv` directory and must have the `.yaml` extension. There are already some files in that directory as reference for the formatting.

Once the server is running, simply visit the following url: 
```
http://localhost:8080/{filename}
```
